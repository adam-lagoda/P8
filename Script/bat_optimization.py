The function first calculates the change in energy delta_E by subtracting the previous energy value prev_E from the current energy value curr_E.

If no energy was used (delta_E == 0), the reward value E_new is set to maximum (1).

If energy was used or saved (delta_E != 0), the reward value E_new is calculated based on the linear equation y = (-1 / prev_E) * x + 1. We calculate the absolute value of delta_E to ensure that the reward value increases as the magnitude of delta_E increases.

To calculate the slope of the line m, we use the formula m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) = (0, 1) and (x2, y2) = (prev_E, 0). So the slope is calculated as:

scss
Copy code
m = (0 - 1) / (prev_E - 0) = -1 / prev_E
The equation for the line is then y = (-1 / prev_E) * x + 1. We substitute x = abs(delta_E) into this equation to get the reward value y.

To ensure that the reward value is between -1 and 1, we use the max and min functions to clamp the value of E_new within that range.

I hope this updated code meets your requirements.
